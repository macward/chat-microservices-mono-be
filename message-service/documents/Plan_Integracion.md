# Message Service Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
The Message Service is a sophisticated microservice designed for processing, storing, and managing messages within the Character Chat API ecosystem. This implementation plan will guide the phased development of the service, focusing on delivering a minimal viable product (MVP) with clear paths for future expansion.

## Key Design Principles
- Asynchronous processing
- High scalability
- Robust error handling
- Multi-provider LLM integration
- Comprehensive analytics
- Content safety

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Core Infrastructure (Critical Path)
1. **Project Setup and Configuration**
   - [ ] Initialize FastAPI project structure
   - [ ] Configure environment variables
   - [ ] Set up basic logging
   - [ ] Implement configuration management
   - [ ] Create initial requirements.txt

2. **Database Configuration**
   - [ ] Set up MongoDB connection with Beanie ODM
   - [ ] Implement initial message model
   - [ ] Create base repository with basic CRUD operations
   - [ ] Set up MongoDB indexes as defined in documentation

3. **Core Message API**
   - [ ] Implement basic `/messages` endpoints
     - POST: Create new message
     - GET: Retrieve messages by conversation

   - [ ] Implement basic rate limiting

4. **Redis Integration**
   - [ ] Configure Redis connection
   - [ ] Implement basic caching for context windows
   - [ ] Set up Redis for basic queuing mechanism

### Phase 2: LLM and Processing Enhancements
1. **LLM Provider Integration**
   - [ ] Create abstract LLM provider interface
   - [ ] Implement initial providers:
     - LM Studio integration
     - Fallback/mock providers
   - [ ] Develop basic context window management
   - [ ] Implement provider selection strategy

2. **Asynchronous Message Processing**
   - [ ] Create background worker for message processing
   - [ ] Implement message queue with Redis Streams
   - [ ] Develop basic async processing workflow
   - [ ] Add basic error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Content Safety**
   - [ ] Implement basic content filtering
   - [ ] Add length validation
   - [ ] Create simple toxicity checking
   - [ ] Develop sanitization strategies

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Optimization
1. **Analytics and Monitoring**
   - [ ] Implement basic Prometheus metrics
   - [ ] Create token usage tracking
   - [ ] Develop real-time performance monitoring
   - [ ] Set up initial Grafana dashboard

2. **Search and Advanced Querying**
   - [ ] Implement basic message search functionality
   - [ ] Add metadata-based filtering
   - [ ] Create initial text search capabilities

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - [ ] Implement multi-level caching strategy
   - [ ] Optimize database queries
   - [ ] Add connection pooling for MongoDB and Redis
   - [ ] Develop basic load balancing strategies

### Phase 4: Extended Integrations and Robustness
1. **Multiple LLM Provider Support**
   - [ ] Add OpenAI provider
   - [ ] Add Anthropic provider
   - [ ] Implement advanced provider selection logic
   - [ ] Create circuit breaker for provider failover

2. **Advanced Security**
   - [ ] Enhance content security pipeline
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive prompt injection protection
   - [ ] Add detailed audit logging
   - [ ] Create advanced rate limiting with user-level controls

3. **Scalability Enhancements**
   - [ ] Develop auto-scaling mechanisms
   - [ ] Create horizontal scaling strategies
   - [ ] Implement advanced load balancing
   - [ ] Add worker specialization for different tasks

## Implementation Constraints and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- Maximum 10,000 messages per conversation
- Maximum 50,000 characters per message
- 100 messages per minute per user
- 32,000 token context window
- 1000 concurrent message processing limit

### Architectural Boundaries
- No conversation management (handled by Conversation Service)
- No authentication (handled by Auth Service)
- No character management (handled by Characters Service)
- Messages are immutable after creation
- Only soft deletion supported

## Recommended Development Workflow
1. Start with Phase 1 infrastructure
2. Develop comprehensive test suite alongside implementation
3. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
4. Continuously monitor performance and iterate
5. Prioritize horizontal scalability from the beginning

## Technology Stack
- Framework: FastAPI 0.104+
- Database: MongoDB with Beanie ODM
- Caching/Queuing: Redis
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Background Processing: Async workers
- LLM Providers: LM Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic (future)

## Risks and Mitigation
- High complexity in LLM integration
- Potential performance bottlenecks
- Complex error handling in distributed system
- Maintaining low latency with multiple providers

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive circuit breaker implementation
- Multi-level caching
- Careful provider selection and fallback mechanisms
- Continuous performance testing
- Gradual feature rollout with feature flags

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement Phase 1 core infrastructure
4. Develop comprehensive test strategy
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Expected Outcomes
- Scalable message processing microservice
- Flexible LLM integration
- Robust content safety mechanisms
- Real-time analytics and monitoring
- Highly available and performant system
